				<u>1. Improves coordination<br></u>
				When an adult or child is playing a video game, he or she is not only staring at the computer inactively. The activities and actions on the screen provide a lot of mental stimulation. For one to play, he or she will need to coordinate their visual, audial and physical movement.<br>
				<br>
				<center> <img src="concentrate.jpg"><br></center>
				<u> 2. Improves problem-solving skills</u><br>
				Video games involve certain rules. This means that the player has to think carefully before making any move to ensure that they stay within the required rules of that particular game. The player needs to make split- second decisions that will determine whether or not he or she will advance to the next level.<br><img src="problem%20solving.jpg"><br>

				<u>3. Enhances memory</u><br>
				Playing your favorite video game may require both visual and audial memory. The player is required to read or listen to the instructions which might only be provided at the beginning of the game, thus the need to remember them throughout the entire game. Mastery of the keys on your keyboard helps you easily move your characters in the game. This helps improve your memory, whether short- term or long-term.
				<br>
				<center><img src="memory.jpg"></center><br>

				<u> 4. Improves attention and concentration</u><br>
				Video games especially action games, have proven to be able to capture the player's attention for the entire period of the game. This is brought about by the player's need to achieve certain objectives within the game, and be able to progress to the next level.
				<br><img src="concentrate%20002.jpg"> <br>

				<u>5. It is a great source of learning</u><br>
				Gaming is not only beneficial to adults and teenagers, but to children as well. Many modern education institutions incorporate video games as a teaching methodology. This helps these children improve their academic skills by providing video games that are specifically aimed at enhancing their cognitive and creative skills.
				<br>
				<center><img src="learning.png"></center><br>

				<u>6. Improves the brain's speed</u><br>
				While gaming, the brain receives multiple stimulations, both Visual and audial. According to research, individuals who play video games frequently can process these stimulators faster than others. These stimulators ensure that the brain is continuously working to interpret them.
				<br> <img src="brain%20speed.jpg"> <br>

				<u>7. Enhances multitasking skills</u><br>
				An action game, for example, may require you to be very observant. It requires you to be able to move your joystick or keys while looking at the various features on your screen such as energy levels, oncoming adversaries, ammunitions left, available time among other factors, all which are vital to winning. This ensures that the player can observe and react accordingly to all requirements of that particular game.
				<br>
				<center><img src="multitasking.jpg"></center><br>

				<u>8. Improves social skills</u><br>
				Online gaming enables many players to engage in a particular game simultaneously. As such, there is constant communication between the players which in turn results in the development of meaningful as well as casual relationships among them.


				This helps players meet new friends while also strengthening bonds with their old friends.Though computer games might be beneficial, there is need to play them in moderation. It is also important to pick the right game as not all of them provide the same cognitive benefits. Age should also be a factor. Small children should not be exposed to violent games.<br>

				<br> <u>9. Video Games May Slow Down Aging</u> <br>
				Male, female, young adult, middle-aged person– all have one thing in common and that’s aging.
				And while getting older and wiser has its perks, there are also a number of natural problems that come about as well.
				There’s a reason why you see senior citizens driving at 25 MPH even though the speed limit is 45.
				But just like maintaining a healthy exercise routine can help your body feel 50 when you’re 60, our brain can also be kept ‘in shape’.
				It seems performing any task that requires exercising your mind will help it stay sharper, and that includes video games.<br>
				<img src="ageing.jpg">
				<br> <u>10. Better Decision Maker</u> <br>
				C. Shawn Green from the University of Rochester wanted to see how games affect our ability to make decisions.
				His goal was to test if games, which demand us to view and keep track of moving peripheral images, improve our ability to receive sensory data and thus help us make more precise decisions.

				The study had a group of young adults with no gaming experience play an action game for 50 hours.
				A second group of the same age played a slow-paced strategy game instead.

				A colleague of his even went on to say that shooters can change the brain by dramatically enhancing many of our low level perceptual functions. Definitely good news for all the Halo and Call of Duty fans out there. <br>

				<br> <u>11. Games Can Help (Not Hurt!) Your Eyesight.</u> <br>

				There are few gamer kids who grew up without ever hearing their parents say “you’re going to go blind watching that screen all day” .
				For a while it did seem like they had a point since we tend to blink much less frequently while playing a game.
				This can cause serious problems like eyestrain and dry eye syndrome.
				Another team of researchers from the University of Rochester sought to prove if games really worsen our vision.
				The 2009 study involved having a group of experienced first-person shooter gamers play Call of Duty and Unreal Tournament 2004 while more casual gamers played slow games like The Sims 2 .
				After testing, those who played the first-person shooters showed signs of having better vision that the others.
				Daphne Bavelier, the leader of the study, discovered that playing action games improves an ability called contrast sensitivity function.
				This ability helps us discern between changes in shades of gray against a colored backdrop, which is very beneficial while driving at night.
				<br>

				<br> <u>13. Games Can Enhance Your Ability To Learn</u> <br>

				Contrary to popular belief that video games make you bad at school, researchers from the UK found that certain video games can actually enhance our brain flexibility.
				The study was done at both the University College London and Queen Mary University of London and had 72 volunteers play two different games for 40 hours over six to eight weeks.
				The games were Starcraft, a fast real-time strategy game, and The Sims, a slower life-simulation game.


				In other words, the people who played Starcraft boasted better cognitive flexibility since the game requires constant thinking and player input.
				So while slower games may not offer the same benefit, it’s cool to know that our favorite fast-paced games are helping us become better learners while entertaining us.

				<br> <u>14. Video Games May Help Treat Depression </u><br>

				A few years ago researchers in New Zealand sought to find out if video games can be used to treat mental disorders like depression.
				This was done with SPARX, a game specifically designed to provide therapy to teenagers in a way that’s more active and enjoyable than regular counseling.

				Over 168 teens with an average age of 15 participated, with all of them having shown previous signs of depression.
				While half of the group received traditional counseling, the other group got to play SPARX.
				The game involves creating avatars to rid the virtual world of enemies representing gloomy, negative thoughts.
				Every stage also introduced general facts about depression, including ways to relax and deal with negative emotions.



				<br>
				<br> <u>15. Video Games Can Help You Stay Stay Fit</u> <br>
				Of all the benefits from video games on this list, this is the one that most people already know.
				This is likely attributed to Nintendo’s Wii system that introduced motion control gaming to players all over the world.
				Active games like Wii Sports and Wii Fit are to this day found in hospitals and retirement homes.
				Researchers at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center recently performed test to see how much better active games are for kids compared to activities like watching TV and browsing the internet.
				Tests involved measuring the heart rate, self-reported exertion, and energy expenditure of kids aged 10 to 13 while they performed three specific activities:
				playing active video games
				watching television
				walking on a treadmill
				The team discovered that playing motion-control games was was just as beneficial as walking on a treadmill at a speed of 3.5mph.
				Both exercises had the kids burning the same amount of calories, which was nearly three times more than the children just watching Netflix.<br>
